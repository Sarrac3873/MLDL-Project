The objectives of this project is grouping trajectories in order to find common locations crossed by people that rent a scooter to visit a city in Italy. The model built has to be able to distinguish for example the positions related to a trajectory that takes from the train station to the city centre, the ones that move in the city centre, the ones that run through the periphery and so on. 

In particular the steps that involves the project are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Dataset filtering and merging in order to build a dataset tidier and semantically correct;
	\item Analyse features and represent the trajectories in line plots;
	\item Group the positions for each rental and sort them through the timestamp;
	\item Apply heuristic techniques on features;
	\item Apply unsupervised learning techniques on features (as K-Means, Mean Shift...);  
	\item Study the results and evaluate the goodness of clustering;
\end{enumerate}
