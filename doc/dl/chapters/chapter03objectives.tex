The objectives of this project is grouping trajectories in order to find common locations crossed by people that rent a scooter to visit a city in Italy. The model built has to be able to distinguish for example the positions related to a trajectory that takes from the train station to the city centre, the ones that move in the city centre, the ones that run through the periphery and so on.
